# Technical Task Plan: Android Warehouse Chemical Monitoring Application

## 1. Introduction

The Android Warehouse Chemical Monitoring Application is designed to address the need for a modern and efficient solution to replace traditional paper logbooks in warehouse environments. The application is divided into three interconnected components:

1. **Android Desktop Application:**
   - A mobile phone or tablet-based application for Android devices.
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing chemicals in the warehouse.

2. **Communication Program:**
   - Facilitates communication between the Android Desktop Application and the SQL database.
   - Utilizes TCP/IP communication, exchanging data in JSON format.

3. **Database:**
   - Stores essential information related to chemicals, transactions, and user data.
   - Serves as a centralized repository for efficient data management.

### Objectives

- **Efficiency Improvement:**
  - Replace traditional paper logbooks with a digital solution to streamline and enhance the monitoring of chemicals in warehouses.

- **Real-time Data Access:**
  - Enable real-time access to critical information, reducing manual effort and improving decision-making processes.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Develop an intuitive Android application that simplifies the process of logging, tracking, and managing chemicals.

### Need for the Application

The need for this application arises from the limitations of traditional paper-based logbooks, which are often time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack real-time accessibility. The Android Warehouse Chemical Monitoring Application aims to overcome these challenges by providing a digital platform that ensures efficient tracking, secure communication, and centralized data management.
