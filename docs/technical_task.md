# Technical Task Plan: Android Warehouse Chemical Monitoring Application

## 1. Introduction

The Android Warehouse Chemical Monitoring Application is designed to address the need for a modern and efficient solution to replace traditional paper logbooks in warehouse environments. The application is divided into three interconnected components:

1. **Android Desktop Application:**
   - A mobile phone or tablet-based application for Android devices.
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing chemicals in the warehouse.

2. **Communication Program:**
   - Facilitates communication between the Android Desktop Application and the SQL database.
   - Utilizes TCP/IP communication, exchanging data in JSON format.

3. **Database:**
   - Stores essential information related to chemicals, transactions, and user data.
   - Serves as a centralized repository for efficient data management.

### Objectives

- **Efficiency Improvement:**
  - Replace traditional paper logbooks with a digital solution to streamline and enhance the monitoring of chemicals in warehouses.

- **Real-time Data Access:**
  - Enable real-time access to critical information, reducing manual effort and improving decision-making processes.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Develop an intuitive Android application that simplifies the process of logging, tracking, and managing chemicals.

### Need for the Application

The need for this application arises from the limitations of traditional paper-based logbooks, which are often time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack real-time accessibility. The Android Warehouse Chemical Monitoring Application aims to overcome these challenges by providing a digital platform that ensures efficient tracking, secure communication, and centralized data management.

This introduction sets the stage for the subsequent sections, outlining the scope, functionalities, and technical aspects of the Android warehouse chemical monitoring application.

## 2. Project Scope

The project scope outlines the functionalities that will and will not be included in the Android Warehouse Chemical Monitoring Application. The application is designed to cater to three distinct roles: Admin, User, and Storekeeper.

### Inclusions:

#### Admin:
- Administrative dashboard with access to all functionalities.
- User management, including the addition, modification, and removal of users.
- Overview of all chemical transactions.

#### User:
- Ability to log the taking of chemicals, specifying the chemical, quantity, and timestamp.
- Record keeping of returned chemicals, including the quantity and timestamp.
- Receive email notifications if chemicals are not returned by the end of the day.

#### Storekeeper:
- Access to detailed reports, including information on who took chemicals, when they were taken, when they were returned, and the remaining quantity.
- Capability to request reports for specific time periods or chemical types.

### Exclusions:

- **Financial Transactions:**
  - The application will not handle financial transactions related to chemical usage.
  
- **Inventory Management:**
  - Beyond tracking quantities taken and returned, the application will not handle general inventory management tasks.

- **Real-time Monitoring:**
  - While the application provides real-time tracking of chemical transactions, it does not support continuous monitoring during the day.

- **Chemical Ordering:**
  - The application will not include features related to ordering new chemicals or managing chemical supply chains.

### Additional Considerations:

- The application will prioritize simplicity and user-friendliness to ensure ease of use for all roles.
- Security measures will be implemented to safeguard sensitive information.
- Data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations will be integral to the application's design.

This scope sets clear boundaries for the features and functionalities of the Android Warehouse Chemical Monitoring Application, focusing on the essential tasks of tracking chemical transactions and generating relevant reports for effective warehouse management.
